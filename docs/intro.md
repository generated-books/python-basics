# Introduction to Python Basics

Welcome to this AI-generated Jupyter book on Python basics! This comprehensive guide is designed to take you from the fundamentals of Python programming to more advanced topics in data analysis and machine learning.

This book is entirely generated by AI, showcasing the potential of artificial intelligence in creating educational content. You can find the source code used to generate this book in the [`generator.ipynb`](https://github.com/generated-books/python-basics/blob/main/generator.ipynb) file in our GitHub repository.

## Contents

This book covers the following topics:

* [Introduction to Jupyter notebooks](01_introduction_to_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb)
* [Mathematical operations](02_mathematical_operations.ipynb)
* [Data Types: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries](03_data_types_lists_tuples_dictionaries.ipynb)
* [For-loops](04_for_loops.ipynb)
* [Conditional statements](05_conditional_statements.ipynb)
