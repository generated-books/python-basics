# Introduction to Python Basics

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on Python basics! This Jupyter book is designed to take you from the fundamentals of Python programming to more advanced topics in data analysis and machine learning.

This entire book is AI-generated, providing a structured and consistent approach to learning Python. You can find the source code for this book in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/generated-books/python-basics). For those interested in the generation process, the [`generator.ipynb`](https://github.com/generated-books/python-basics/blob/main/generator.ipynb) file in the repository contains all the code used to create this book.

## Contents

This book covers the following topics:

* [Introduction to Jupyter notebooks](01_introduction_to_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb)
* [Mathematical operations](02_mathematical_operations.ipynb)
* [Data Types: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries](03_data_types_lists_tuples_dictionaries.ipynb)
* [For-loops](04_for_loops.ipynb)
* [Conditional statements](05_conditional_statements.ipynb)
